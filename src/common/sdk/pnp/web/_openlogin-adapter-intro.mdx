The default adapter of Web3Auth is the [`openlogin-adapter`](/sdk/pnp/web/adapters/openlogin). This
adapter is a wrapper around the [`openlogin`](/sdk/pnp/web/adapters/openlogin) library from Web3Auth
and enables the social login features. For customising features of the main Web3Auth flow, like
[Whitelabel](/features/whitelabel), [Custom Authentication](/features/custom-authentication), etc.
you need to customise the Openlogin Adapter.

:::tip

Checkout the [`openlogin-adapter`](/sdk/pnp/web/adapters/openlogin) SDK Reference for more details
on different configurations you can pass for customisations.

#### Whitelabeling

##### `whiteLabel`

For customising the redirect screens while logging in and constructing the key, you need to pass on
`whiteLabel` configurations to the `adapterSettings` property of the
[`openlogin-adapter`](/sdk/pnp/web/adapters/openlogin).

:::tip

This is just one of the aspects of whitelabeling you can achieve with Web3Auth. To know more in
depth about how you can Whitelabel your application with Web3Auth, have a look at our
[Whitelabeling SDK Reference](/features/whitelabel).

#### Multi Factor Authentication

##### `mfaLevel`

For a dApp, we provide various options to set up Multi-Factor Authentication. You can customize the
MFA screen by setting the `mfaLevel` argument. You can enable or disable a backup factor and change
their order. Currently, there are four values for `mfaLevel`:

- `default`: presents the MFA screen every third login
- `optional`: presents the MFA screen on every login, but you can skip it
- `mandatory`: make it mandatory to set up MFA after login
- `none`: skips the MFA setup screen

```tsx
import { OpenloginAdapter } from "@web3auth/openlogin-adapter";

const openloginAdapter = new OpenloginAdapter({
  loginSettings: {
    //focus-start
    mfaLevel: "mandatory", // default, optional, mandatory, none
    //focus-end
  },
});
```

:::caution Note

If you are using default verifiers, your users may have set up MFA on other dApps that also use
default Web3Auth verifiers. In this case, the MFA screen will continue to appear if the user has
enabled MFA on other dApps. This is because MFA cannot be turned off once it is enabled.

:::

##### `mfaSettings`

For customising the MFA settings, you need to pass on `mfaSettings` configurations to the
`adapterSettings` property of the `OpenloginAdapter`.

:::tip

Read more about `mfaSettings` in the [Multi Factor Authentication Section](./mfa) SDK Reference.

:::

```tsx
import { OpenloginAdapter } from "@web3auth/openlogin-adapter";

const openloginAdapter = new OpenloginAdapter({
  adapterSettings: {
    //focus-start
    // SCALE and above plan only feature
    mfaSettings: {
      deviceShareFactor: {
        enable: true,
        priority: 1,
        mandatory: true, // at least two factors are mandatory
      },
      backUpShareFactor: {
        enable: true,
        priority: 2,
        mandatory: true, // at least two factors are mandatory
      },
      socialBackupFactor: {
        enable: true,
        priority: 3,
        mandatory: false,
      },
      passwordFactor: {
        enable: true,
        priority: 4,
        mandatory: false,
      },
    },
    //focus-end
  },
});
```

#### Custom Authentication

##### `loginConfig`

With Web3Auth, you have the option to configure logins using your own authentication services. For
adding your own authentication, you have to first configure your verifiers in the Web3Auth
Dashboard.

Custom Authentication in Web3Auth is supported by the Openlogin Adapter, which is the default
adapter for the Web3Auth SDK. For this, you need to configure the `loginConfig` parameter in the
`adapterSettings` of the `openlogin-adapter` package.

:::tip

Refer to the [Custom Authentication Documentation](./custom-authentication) for more information.
