## Introduction

Web3Auth Modal React Hooks provide a powerful and intuitive way to integrate blockchain
authentication and wallet services into your React applications. By leveraging React's modern hooks
architecture, you can manage authentication states, interact with various blockchain networks, and
offer seamless wallet services to your users with minimal setup and clean code practices.

**Key Benefits:**

- Declarative and Modular Code: Utilize React hooks for cleaner and more maintainable code
  structures.
- Easy State Management: Effortlessly manage authentication and wallet states across your
  application.
- Seamless Integration: Quickly integrate with multiple blockchain networks and wallet services.
- Enhanced User Experience: Provide users with smooth and secure authentication and transaction
  workflows.

## Prerequisites

Before proceeding, ensure you have the following:

- Node.js and npm/yarn installed: To manage dependencies and run your React application.
- Basic understanding of React and hooks: Familiarity with React components and hooks is essential.
- Web3Auth account and client ID: Sign up at [Web3Auth Dashboard](https://dashboard.web3auth.io/) to
  obtain your client ID.

## Full-Fledged Example

For a comprehensive example of integrating Web3Auth Modal React Hooks, refer to the official GitHub
repository:

**GitHub Repository:**
[Web3Auth EVM Modal Example](https://github.com/Web3Auth/web3auth-pnp-examples/tree/main/web-modal-sdk/blockchain-connection-examples/evm-modal-example)

This repository demonstrates a complete setup, including authentication flows and blockchain
interactions using EVM-compatible networks.

## Installation

Begin by installing the necessary packages using npm:

```bash
npm install @web3auth/modal-react-hooks @web3auth/wallet-services-plugin-react-hooks @web3auth/ethereum-provider @web3auth/openlogin-adapter
```

## Setting Up Providers

Wrap your main application component with `Web3AuthProvider` and `WalletServicesProvider` to inject
the necessary contexts throughout your app.

```jsx title="index.tsx"
import React from "react";
import ReactDOM from "react-dom";
import App from "./App";
import { Web3AuthProvider } from "@web3auth/modal-react-hooks";
import { WalletServicesProvider } from "@web3auth/wallet-services-plugin-react-hooks";
import { web3AuthConfig } from "./web3AuthConfig";

ReactDOM.render(
  <Web3AuthProvider config={web3AuthConfig}>
    <WalletServicesProvider>
      <App />
    </WalletServicesProvider>
  </Web3AuthProvider>,
  document.getElementById("root"),
);
```

## Configuring Web3Auth

Create a separate configuration file to manage all Web3Auth-related settings.

```typescript title="web3AuthConfig.ts"
import { Web3AuthOptions } from "@web3auth/modal";
import { OpenloginAdapter } from "@web3auth/openlogin-adapter";
import { CHAIN_NAMESPACES, WEB3AUTH_NETWORK } from "@web3auth/base";
import { EthereumPrivateKeyProvider } from "@web3auth/ethereum-provider";
import { WalletServicesPlugin } from "@web3auth/wallet-services-plugin";

const chainConfig = {
  chainId: "0xaa36a7", // Sepolia Testnet
  displayName: "Ethereum Sepolia",
  chainNamespace: CHAIN_NAMESPACES.EIP155,
  tickerName: "Ethereum Sepolia",
  ticker: "ETH",
  rpcTarget: "https://rpc.ankr.com/eth_sepolia",
  blockExplorerUrl: "https://sepolia.etherscan.io",
  logo: "https://cryptologos.cc/logos/ethereum-eth-logo.png",
};

const privateKeyProvider = new EthereumPrivateKeyProvider({
  config: {
    chainConfig,
  },
});

const web3AuthOptions: Web3AuthOptions = {
  clientId:
    "BPi5PB_UiIZ-cPz1GtV5i1I2iOSOHuimiXBI0e-Oe_u6X3oVAbCiAZOTEBtTXw4tsluTITPqA8zMsfxIKMjiqNQ",
  web3AuthNetwork: WEB3AUTH_NETWORK.SAPPHIRE_MAINNET,
  privateKeyProvider,
};

const openloginAdapter = new OpenloginAdapter();

const walletServicesPlugin = new WalletServicesPlugin({
  wsEmbedOpts: {},
  walletInitOptions: { whiteLabel: { showWidgetButton: true } },
});

export const web3AuthConfig = {
  web3AuthOptions,
  adapters: [openloginAdapter],
  plugins: [walletServicesPlugin],
};
```

**Explanation of Configuration:**

- **`chainConfig`:** Specifies the blockchain network details. Adjust the `chainId` and `rpcTarget`
  according to the network you intend to support.
- **`web3AuthOptions`:** Contains essential configurations such as `clientId`, network type, and UI
  customization options.
- **`OpenloginAdapter`:** Facilitates authentication using various social logins and traditional
  methods.
- **`WalletServicesPlugin`:** Provides additional wallet functionalities like WalletConnect
  integration and fiat on-ramps.

## Implementing Authentication and Wallet Services

Utilize the hooks provided by Web3Auth to manage authentication flows and wallet services within
your application components.

```jsx title="App.tsx"
import React, { useEffect, useState } from "react";
import { useWeb3Auth } from "@web3auth/modal-react-hooks";
import { useWalletServicesPlugin } from "@web3auth/wallet-services-plugin-react-hooks";
import RPC from "./rpc"; // Assuming you create a custom RPC class like the full-fledged example

const App = () => {
  const { initModal, provider, connect, logout, isConnected, userInfo } = useWeb3Auth();
  const { showWalletConnectScanner, showCheckout, showWalletUI } = useWalletServicesPlugin();
  const [balance, setBalance] = useState<string>("");

  useEffect(() => {
    const initialize = async () => {
      await initModal();
    };
    initialize();
  }, [initModal]);

  const fetchBalance = async () => {
    if (provider) {
      const rpc = new RPC(provider as any);
      const balance = await rpc.getBalance();
      setBalance(balance);
    }
  };

  const sendTransaction = async () => {
    if (provider) {
      const rpc = new RPC(provider as any);
      await rpc.sendTransaction();
    }
  };

  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Web3Auth Modal React Hooks Example</h1>
      {!isConnected ? (
        <button onClick={connect}>Login with Web3Auth</button>
      ) : (
        <>
          <div>
            <p>Name: {userInfo?.name}</p>
            <p>Email: {userInfo?.email}</p>
          </div>
          <button onClick={fetchBalance}>Fetch Balance</button>
          {balance && <p>Your Balance: {balance} ETH</p>}
          <button onClick={sendTransaction}>Send 0.01 ETH</button>
          <button onClick={showWalletConnectScanner}>Connect to dApp via WalletConnect</button>
          <button onClick={showCheckout}>Top-up Wallet</button>
          <button onClick={showWalletUI}>Show Wallet UI</button>
          <button onClick={logout}>Logout</button>
        </>
      )}
    </div>
  );
};

export default App;
```

**Explanation of Code:**

- **Initialization:** The `initModal` method is called when the app starts to initialize the
  Web3Auth modal.
- **Authentication Flow:** Users can log in, view their info, and log out using the `connect` and
  `logout` methods from `useWeb3Auth`.
- **Blockchain Interactions:** The app can fetch the user's ETH balance and send transactions using
  a custom RPC class like in the full-fledged example.
- **Wallet Services:** Additional wallet functionalities like WalletConnect, wallet top-up, and
  wallet UI are integrated using `useWalletServicesPlugin`.

For more details on connecting to blockchain networks using custom RPC clients, refer to the
[Web3Auth Blockchain Connection Documentation](https://web3auth.io/docs/connect-blockchain/evm/ethereum/web).
