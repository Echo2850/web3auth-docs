## Introduction

Web3Auth No Modal React Hooks provide a powerful and flexible way to integrate blockchain
authentication and wallet services into your React applications without relying on a modal UI. By
leveraging React's hooks architecture, you can manage authentication states, interact with various
blockchain networks, and offer seamless wallet services to your users with full control over the UI.

**Key Benefits:**

- Declarative and Modular Code: Utilize React hooks for cleaner and more maintainable code
  structures.
- Easy State Management: Effortlessly manage authentication and wallet states across your
  application.
- Seamless Integration: Quickly integrate with multiple blockchain networks and wallet services.
- Enhanced User Experience: Provide users with smooth and secure authentication and transaction
  workflows without a modal UI.

## Prerequisites

Before proceeding, ensure you have the following:

- Node.js and npm/yarn installed: To manage dependencies and run your React application.
- Basic understanding of React and hooks: Familiarity with React components and hooks is essential.
- Web3Auth account and client ID: Sign up at [Web3Auth Dashboard](https://dashboard.web3auth.io/) to
  obtain your client ID.

## Installation

Begin by installing the necessary packages using npm or yarn:

```bash
npm install @web3auth/no-modal-react-hooks @web3auth/ethereum-provider @web3auth/openlogin-adapter
```

## Setting Up Providers

Wrap your main application component with `Web3AuthProvider` to inject the necessary context
throughout your app.

```jsx title="index.tsx"
import React from "react";
import ReactDOM from "react-dom";
import App from "./App";
import { Web3AuthProvider } from "@web3auth/no-modal-react-hooks";
import { web3AuthConfig } from "./web3AuthConfig";

ReactDOM.render(
  <Web3AuthProvider config={web3AuthConfig}>
    <App />
  </Web3AuthProvider>,
  document.getElementById("root"),
);
```

## Configuring Web3Auth

Create a separate configuration file to manage all Web3Auth-related settings.

```typescript title="web3AuthConfig.ts"
import { Web3AuthOptions } from "@web3auth/no-modal-react-hooks";
import { OpenloginAdapter } from "@web3auth/openlogin-adapter";
import { CHAIN_NAMESPACES, WEB3AUTH_NETWORK } from "@web3auth/base";
import { EthereumPrivateKeyProvider } from "@web3auth/ethereum-provider";

const chainConfig = {
  chainId: "0xaa36a7", // Sepolia Testnet
  displayName: "Ethereum Sepolia",
  chainNamespace: CHAIN_NAMESPACES.EIP155,
  tickerName: "Ethereum Sepolia",
  ticker: "ETH",
  rpcTarget: "https://rpc.ankr.com/eth_sepolia",
  blockExplorerUrl: "https://sepolia.etherscan.io",
  logo: "https://cryptologos.cc/logos/ethereum-eth-logo.png",
};

const privateKeyProvider = new EthereumPrivateKeyProvider({
  config: {
    chainConfig,
  },
});

const web3AuthOptions: Web3AuthOptions = {
  clientId:
    "BPi5PB_UiIZ-cPz1GtV5i1I2iOSOHuimiXBI0e-Oe_u6X3oVAbCiAZOTEBtTXw4tsluTITPqA8zMsfxIKMjiqNQ",
  web3AuthNetwork: WEB3AUTH_NETWORK.SAPPHIRE_MAINNET,
  privateKeyProvider,
};

const openloginAdapter = new OpenloginAdapter();

export const web3AuthConfig = {
  web3AuthOptions,
  adapters: [openloginAdapter],
};
```

**Explanation of Configuration:**

- **`chainConfig`:** Specifies the blockchain network details. Adjust the `chainId` and `rpcTarget`
  according to the network you intend to support.
- **`web3AuthOptions`:** Contains essential configurations such as `clientId`, network type, and UI
  customization options.
- **`OpenloginAdapter`:** Facilitates authentication using various social logins and traditional
  methods.

## Abstracting RPC Methods

For handling blockchain interactions like fetching balances and sending transactions, refer to the
[Web3Auth Blockchain Connection Guide](https://web3auth.io/docs/connect-blockchain/evm/ethereum/web).
This guide will help you set up an abstracted RPC class, similar to the one used in full-fledged
examples, to cleanly manage your blockchain operations.

## Implementing Authentication and Wallet Services

Utilize the hooks provided by Web3Auth to manage authentication flows and wallet services within
your application components.

```jsx title="App.tsx"
import React, { useEffect, useState } from "react";
import { useWeb3Auth } from "@web3auth/no-modal-react-hooks";
import { useWalletServicesPlugin } from "@web3auth/wallet-services-plugin-react-hooks";
import RPC from "./rpc"; // Assuming you create a custom RPC class like the full-fledged example
import { WALLET_ADAPTERS } from "@web3auth/base";

const App = () => {
  const { init, provider, connectTo, logout, isConnected, userInfo } = useWeb3Auth();
  const { showWalletConnectScanner, showCheckout, showWalletUI } = useWalletServicesPlugin();
  const [balance, setBalance] = useState < string > "";

  useEffect(() => {
    const initialize = async () => {
      await init();
    };
    initialize();
  }, [init]);

  const fetchBalance = async () => {
    if (provider) {
      const rpc = new RPC(provider);
      const balance = await rpc.getBalance();
      setBalance(balance);
    }
  };

  const sendTransaction = async () => {
    if (provider) {
      const rpc = new RPC(provider as any);
      await rpc.sendTransaction();
    }
  };

  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Web3Auth No Modal React Hooks Example</h1>
      {!isConnected ? (
        <button
          onClick={() =>
            connectTo(WALLET_ADAPTERS.OPENLOGIN, {
              loginProvider: "google",
            })
          }
        >
          Login with Web3Auth
        </button>
      ) : (
        <>
          <div>
            <p>Name: {userInfo?.name}</p>
            <p>Email: {userInfo?.email}</p>
          </div>
          <button onClick={fetchBalance}>Fetch Balance</button>
          {balance && <p>Your Balance: {balance} ETH</p>}
          <button onClick={sendTransaction}>Send 0.01 ETH</button>
          <button onClick={showWalletConnectScanner}>Connect to dApp via WalletConnect</button>
          <button onClick={showCheckout}>Top-up Wallet</button>
          <button onClick={showWalletUI}>Show Wallet UI</button>
          <button onClick={logout}>Logout</button>
        </>
      )}
    </div>
  );
};

export default App;
```

**Explanation of Code:**

- **Initialization:** The `init` method is called when the app starts to initialize the Web3Auth
  instance.
- **Authentication Flow:** Users can log in, view their info, and log out using the `connect` and
  `logout` methods from `useWeb3Auth`.
- **Blockchain Interactions:** The app can fetch the user's ETH balance and send transactions using
  a custom RPC class like in the full-fledged example.
- **Wallet Services:** Additional wallet functionalities like WalletConnect, wallet top-up, and
  wallet UI are integrated using `useWalletServicesPlugin`.

For more details on connecting to blockchain networks using custom RPC clients, refer to the
[Web3Auth Blockchain Connection Documentation](https://web3auth.io/docs/connect-blockchain/evm/ethereum/web).

## Accessing SDK References

For detailed information on all available methods and configurations, refer to the official SDK
documentation:

- **No Modal React Hooks SDK Reference:**
  [Web3Auth No Modal React Hooks Documentation](https://web3auth.io/docs/sdk/pnp/web/no-modal/no-modal-hooks)

These references provide comprehensive details on all exposed methods, configurations, and advanced
usage scenarios.
